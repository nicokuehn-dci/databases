## Introduction

When performing searches in a database, case sensitivity can affect the results of the queries. This tutorial covers how to perform case-insensitive searches in SQL using PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MySQL.

Case-insensitive searches are essential for creating user-friendly applications where users expect search functions to work regardless of case differences.

---

## Why Is It Important?

Performing case-insensitive searches is crucial in many real-world applications. Users often expect search functions to work regardless of case differences, such as when looking for:
- Names
- Product titles  
- Email addresses

This improves user experience and minimizes missed data.

### Example Scenario
A user's email address might be stored as `SomeOne@baeldung.com`, but users should be able to find it by searching for `someone@baeldung.com`, regardless of the casing used in the query.

### Test Data Setup
For demonstration purposes, we'll use a Course table with this additional record:

```sql
INSERT INTO Course values 
('CS119', 'OPERATING SYSTEM Principles', 'OS by Abraham Silberschatz', 7, true)
```

**Important Note:** For this tutorial, we assume that case-insensitive settings are disabled at the database level:
- MySQL and SQL Server: Default to case-insensitive behavior
- PostgreSQL: Case-sensitive by default for string comparisons

---

## Using the UPPER/LOWER Functions

### Universal Method (Works across all SQL databases)

The most common and portable method for case-insensitive partial string searches is to combine the `UPPER()` or `LOWER()` functions with the `LIKE` operator.

#### Example Query
```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM Course 
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%operating%'
```

#### Expected Results
```
+-------+---------------------------------------------+
|  id   |                    name                     |
+-------+---------------------------------------------+
| CS111 | Introduction to Operating Systems           |
| CS112 | Introduction to Real Time Operating Systems |
| CS211 | Operating Systems: Intermediate             |
| CS212 | Real Time Operating Systems: Intermediate   |
| CS411 | Advanced Operating Systems                  |
| CS119 | OPERATING SYSTEM Principles                 |
+-------+---------------------------------------------+
```

#### Important Notes
- When using `LOWER()`, the search string must be in lowercase
- When using `UPPER()`, the search string must be in uppercase
- This method is compatible with all standard SQL databases

## PostgreSQL Specific Methods

PostgreSQL offers several specialized approaches for case-insensitive searches.

### 4.1. Using ILIKE Operator

PostgreSQL provides the `ILIKE` operator specifically for case-insensitive searches.

```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM Course 
WHERE name ILIKE '%operating%'
```

**Benefits:**
- Similar syntax to `LIKE` operator
- No need to explicitly convert case using functions
- PostgreSQL-specific but very clean syntax

### 4.2. Using Regular Expression

PostgreSQL provides robust built-in regular expressions for case-insensitive searches using the `~*` operator:

```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM Course 
WHERE name ~* 'OPERATING'
```

**Benefits:**
- Allows complex regular expressions for various scenarios
- Case-insensitive matching
- Very flexible for pattern matching

**Note:** Complex regular expression patterns are beyond this tutorial's scope. Refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP) for more details.

For comprehensive PostgreSQL regex information, see our dedicated [PostgreSQL POSIX Regex Guide](postgresql_posix_regex_guide.md).

## MySQL Specific Methods

MySQL offers several database-specific approaches for case-insensitive searches.

### 5.1. Using REGEXP_LIKE Function

The `REGEXP_LIKE` function allows the use of regular expressions in queries:

```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM Course 
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(name, 'OPERATING', 'i');
```

#### Parameters:
1. **Column name** - The column or value to apply the expression on
2. **Pattern** - The pattern to match
3. **Match option** - `'i'` for case-insensitive, `'c'` for case-sensitive

### 5.2. Using COLLATE

The `COLLATE` clause defines rules for string comparison, including case sensitivity:

```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM Course 
WHERE name COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci LIKE '%OPERATING%';
```

**Benefits:**
- Provides flexibility in handling different types of string comparisons
- No need to alter underlying column or database collation
- `utf8mb4_general_ci` ensures case-insensitive comparison

---

## SQL Server Methods

### Using COLLATE Clause

SQL Server uses the `COLLATE` clause to adjust search behavior:

```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM Course 
WHERE name COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS like '%OPERATING%'
```

- `Latin1_General_CI_AS` collation enables case-insensitive comparison
- Similar to MySQL's COLLATE approach but with different collation names

## Summary & Comparison

### Method Compatibility Matrix

| Method                               | PostgreSQL        | MySQL            | SQL Server       |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| UPPER/LOWER                          | ✅ Supported     | ✅ Supported     | ✅ Supported     |
| ILIKE Operator                       | ✅ Supported     | ❌ Not Supported | ❌ Not Supported |
| Regular Expression                   | ✅ Supported     | ✅ Supported     | ❌ No Support    |
| COLLATE Clause                       | ❌ Not Supported | ✅ Supported     | ✅ Supported     |

### Performance Considerations

#### UPPER/LOWER Functions
- **Pros:** Widely supported across all databases
- **Cons:** Can bypass indexes unless a functional index is created
- **Index Support:** MySQL and PostgreSQL support functional indexes; SQL Server doesn't

#### Regular Expressions
- **Pros:** Offer great flexibility for complex patterns
- **Cons:** Slower performance and not index-friendly

#### COLLATE Clause
- **Pros:** Index-friendly when available
- **Cons:** Unavailable for partial searches in PostgreSQL
- **Important:** Selecting the right collation is crucial for proper comparison behavior

## Conclusion

This guide explored various methods to perform case-insensitive searches in SQL across different database systems. Key takeaways:

1. **Universal Method:** `UPPER()`/`LOWER()` functions work across all SQL databases
2. **PostgreSQL:** `ILIKE` operator provides the cleanest syntax
3. **MySQL:** `COLLATE` clause offers good performance with proper indexing
4. **SQL Server:** `COLLATE` clause is the preferred method
5. **Performance:** Regular expressions are powerful but less efficient for large datasets

Choose the method that best fits your database system and performance requirements.
